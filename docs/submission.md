# Submission draft: RECALLGUARD

## Status: **GO**. The RecallGuard release (rebrand, MCP, four-page site, live-verdict panel) is pushed and deployed; the submission portal has NOT been touched. The author fills the remaining fields and submits. Nothing has been submitted to the portal, posted, or registered.

**Deadline: 2026-11-10 17:00 UTC.** Judging Nov 11–16. Recommended submission: **Nov 10, morning UTC**.
The submission form itself has **not** been filled or sent. **You** review and send.

| Published item | URL | State |
|---|---|---|
| **Repository (public)** | <https://github.com/unifyWeb3/recallguard> | renamed from `freshness-bound-recall` on 2026-11-08 (GitHub redirects the old URL); pushed through the 2026-11-08 Stage B commits; full history preserved |
| **Hosted page: RecallGuard Stage B** | <https://recallguard-oxunify.vercel.app> | four pages + `/api/live-verdict` serverless function; alias kept alongside the originals; deployment id and hash readback recorded in `reports/stageB.md` |

> The hosted page is a **static export of a labelled snapshot**, not a live service; it makes no
> network requests. The live proof page stays a local process.

Field list below matches the live form (as read read-only on 2026-11-04; **re-verify the form before sending**).

**Acceptance review on 2026-11-06, before the homepage milestone:** the CLI installed into a genuinely
empty consumer folder (31 packages in about five seconds, no lifecycle hooks) and ran with no `.env`.
The default sample was read-only and returned `STALE/WITHHELD` with zero writes. The recorded revision
lifecycle returned `STALE → FRESH → STALE`, resolved predecessor blob
`goZjQJ36yLVBG6oPyHqR6wgYQ9HbmISoe-3HWkVB1AY` to correction blob
`mjxZQ1X2xn5Xlvd-gBsBAIrD5rkUDwFCAn1NEX0gbWY`, and disclosed that the later historical event recalled
proof-equivalent blob `zAji1w8p4REMzUF2o1V7IfgfQlpN7np7Qs8ehtNVXHg`. The correction persisted 117,242 ms after its proof;
the first post-persistence check 1,381 ms later withheld it as stale. Missing, ambiguous, and invalid
evidence failed closed. Baseline suite before homepage work: **120 tests / 120 pass / 0 fail / 0 skipped**;
focused acceptance: **30/30 pass**. The homepage milestone suite was **123 tests / 123 pass / 0 fail /
0 skipped**; the current Milestone 3 suite is **127 tests / 127 pass / 0 fail / 0 skipped**. Secrets
audit: **11 passes / 0 failures**; full-history audit: **0 findings**. Live
read-only recall confirmed both lineage blobs still exist and semantic recall returns the correction.
No Mainnet writes, push, deployment, or secrets changes were performed.

The earlier freeze bundle remains `freeze/freeze-2026-11-05T145207337Z.json` (22 memories · 306 ledger
entries, live checkpoint 341948733); the namespace check recorded 22 memories, 0 deleted, and
`must_resync=false`.

> **2026-11-07 release addendum (RecallGuard).** The product was renamed to RecallGuard (repo URL
> unchanged) and the MCP gap from the previous submission draft was closed: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
> over stdio; six tools (`recall_checked`, `explain_decision`, `list_revisions`, `get_evidence`,
> `propose_correction`, `store_correction`), read-only by default; `store_correction` is triple-gated
> and remains disabled everywhere. 16 protocol-level MCP tests via `InMemoryTransport` plus a real
> stdio smoke client (`npm run mcp:smoke`, all checks PASS). Claude Code (2.1.318) and Codex CLI
> (0.167.0) configurations were verified with isolated `HOME`s. The public site was rebuilt as four
> static pages (home / MCP / evidence / docs) and deployed to the existing Vercel project after
> release checks; the hosted page now shows the RecallGuard release. Suite: **149 tests / 149 pass /
> 0 fail / 0 skipped**. No Mainnet writes, no secrets changes. The live read-only CLI remains
> **unverified end to end** and is labelled as such everywhere.

> **2026-11-08 Stage B addendum.** Repo renamed to `unifyWeb3/recallguard` (git remote updated;
> redirect verified at the git layer; old Vercel aliases kept). New production alias
> `recallguard-oxunify.vercel.app` added. Production-only env vars set: `TATUM_API_KEY` (sensitive),
> `LIVE_CHECK=on`, `TATUM_SMOKE_DAILY_CAP=25`, used only by the `/api/live-verdict` panel (fixed
> queries, 3 s timeout, 30 s edge cache, best-effort per-instance daily cap documented as
> best-effort, kill switch via `LIVE_CHECK`). The homepage was rewritten user-first with the live
> verdict panel and a hypothetical treasury-delegate example (labelled); blob links point at the
> official Walrus aggregator read path; `og.png` (1200×630, pure-Node generator) + `og:image`.
> `CLAIMS.md` links 22 claims to blobs/tests/reports; `docs/video-facts.json` is generated from the
> snapshot + CLAIMS (single source of numbers). Suite: **162 tests / 162 pass**. No Walrus writes,
> no secrets changes; the live read-only CLI remains **unverified end to end** and is labelled.

> **The freeze bundle is git-ignored.** `freeze/` is a local artifact directory (it contains the full
> ledger copy and the proof snapshot). If the repo is hosted for judges, **either attach
> `freeze/freeze-2026-11-05T145207337Z.json` through the form's `additionalDocs` field** (recommended)
> **or rely on the committed equivalent**, which *is* in the repo:
> `docs/evidence/proof-snapshot.json` (22 memories, 306 decisions, the `x-api-key` proof) plus
> `reports/pre-submit.md`. The demo and proof page do **not** require the namespace or the bundle at
> judging time: `npm run demo:offline`, `npm run proof:offline` and `npm run export` all run from the
> committed snapshot.

## Suggested description (Track 02 stated explicitly; the form has no track field)

> Track 02: Smart Agents for Real Life
>
> RecallGuard is the freshness gate for AI-agent memory, a Walrus Memory agent that will never
> answer from a stale memory. Every answer is routed through a **freshness gate on the answer path**:
> checkpoint window (Tatum Sui mainnet GraphQL, 1 cached read) ∧ subject version/digest pin (1 read)
> ∧ wall-clock backstop, failing closed with a visible reason. Stale memories are never answers; when
> a claim is re-verified differently, a correction memory supersedes the old record (blob id when
> available, exact claim fallback while a write is still in flight; the proof view resolves both) and
> the tolerance itself (a per-class policy memory: `fc-policy-FAST-v1`, `fc-policy-SLOW-v2`) is
> rewritten by the system from observed decay (FALSE-STALE widens, MISSED-CHANGE tightens; one policy
> memory per change).
>
> RecallGuard is also an MCP server (stdio): six tools; `recall_checked` enforces the same gate
> for MCP-compatible agents (Claude Code and Codex configurations tested); `store_correction` is
> triple-gated and read-only by default. Recalled memory content is treated as untrusted data.
>
> Evidence: 22 mainnet Walrus blobs in namespace `freshness-recall` (7 observer observations, 4
> corrections, 2 learned-policy memories, 1 historical adversarial specimen (it predates the
> anchor-proof fix), 8 live round-trip test memories); 306 recorded stale/fresh decisions with
> checkpoint stamps; an ablation table on the evidence page; both learning directions persisted as
> memories and read back before every answer; everything pinned (Node v26.13.0), zero LLM in the answer
> path, `.env`-only secrets with a startup on-chain credential self-test.

## Repo contents: the public repo is already live

<https://github.com/unifyWeb3/recallguard>: public, pushed with the **full commit history**
(the hashes cited in `reports/`, e.g. `f9832ac`, resolve on GitHub). It contains `README.md`, `src/`,
`scripts/`, `test/`, `fixtures/`, `docs/` (this file, `blog.md`, `video-script.md`, `judge-60s.md`),
`reports/build-phase1.md` … (all evidence, all labels), `data/claim-class-measurement.json`,
`.nvmrc`, `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`.
**Never the `.env`**. It is git-ignored, untracked, and the secrets audit passes on the working tree
*and* on every pushed commit.

## Order of operations before Nov 10 17:00 UTC

1. Re-verify the submission form field list and this draft (agent reads it at your request, read-only).
2. Record the demo per `docs/video-script.md`; upload to a venue you control; paste the URL.
3. ~~Publish or host the repo~~: **done**: <https://github.com/unifyWeb3/recallguard> (paste
   it into `repoUrl`).
4. Fill remaining fields; tick the **event-rules acceptance checkbox** (you, not the agent); attach `docs/` if asked; keep the Track 02 line in the description.
5. Submit, then verify the confirmation page; keep the submission id.
6. Bonus: post X/LinkedIn (your accounts) tagging the event; paste URLs in socialPosts before submitting,
   otherwise leave `none`.

## AI-assistance disclosure (state this plainly; check the form's rule before submitting)

The code in this repository and the scripts/notes for the video were produced primarily with AI
coding agents (OpenAI/agent harness sessions over 2026-11-04 → 2026-11-09), directed and reviewed by
the submitter, who is solely responsible for the submission. The recorded Mainnet evidence is real;
the demo replays it offline; the live-verdict panel performs real reads at click time with a
best-effort daily cap and a kill switch. The submission form asks about Tatum AI Builder; that tool
was **not** used (the project uses Tatum's Sui Mainnet GraphQL gateway only). **The submitter must
read the form's AI-assistance/eligibility rule and decide whether and how to disclose this in the
"How was your experience…" fields before ticking the event-rules checkbox.** Nothing in this draft
authorizes accepting terms on the submitter's behalf.

## X / LinkedIn post drafts (bonus points; post only from your accounts, after review)

Draft A (technical):
> I built RecallGuard for the @Tatum_io × @WalrusFoundation Total Recall hackathon. An agent
> recalled a fact, the chain had moved on, and the agent was about to act on it. RecallGuard is a
> fail-closed gate that checks Walrus-backed memory against live Sui state (Tatum GraphQL) before
> the answer can be used. Recorded lifecycle replays offline: STALE → FRESH → STALE. {LIVE_URL}

Draft B (product):
> "Your agent remembers. RecallGuard checks whether it's still true." 🧵
> 22 memories + 306 decisions recorded on Mainnet · corrections supersede stale memories · freshness
> windows are themselves memories in Walrus. Built for Track 02: Smart Agents for Real Life. {VIDEO_URL} #TotalRecall

**Known open items at 2026-11-05:** Walrus epoch retention not verified (unknown; expiry before
judging cannot be ruled out); Tatum credits per call not measured (unknown; `npm run credits` prints the
request count for a dashboard comparison); no real user validated the persona (hypothesis); the Docker
image path is written but unverified (no Docker daemon in the build environment); the `fc-policy-SLOW-v2`
memory carries one malformed auxiliary field (`policy.evidence_count=undefined`) caused by a
variable-name slip in the writer; the evidence list itself is intact in the record body, and the
policy engine does not read that field. Fixing the blob would need a second write, which needs the
author's confirmation.
