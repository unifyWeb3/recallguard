**Runtime:** Node >=24. The accepted runtime is pinned in `.nvmrc`.

# Judge quickstart — real revision proof in 60 seconds

The shortest useful path is credential-free, offline, read-only, and deterministic. It needs no
`.env`, wallet, Mainnet access, or write approval.

## 1. Clone, install, and run the lifecycle

Run this from an otherwise empty working directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/unifyWeb3/recallguard.git freshness-recall
cd freshness-recall
nvm use                         # optional
npm install --ignore-scripts    # lifecycle scripts never run
npm run recall:checked -- --sample sui-clock-revision-lifecycle
```

The product output was:

```text
RecallGuard · recorded Mainnet lifecycle · read-only
STALE → FRESH → STALE
Predecessor: obs-sui-clock-341742424 · goZjQJ36yLVBG6oPyHqR6wgYQ9HbmISoe-3HWkVB1AY · checkpoint 341742424

```

This is the recorded revision lifecycle, not a fabricated fixture:

- Predecessor Walrus blob: `goZjQJ36yLVBG6oPyHqR6wgYQ9HbmISoe-3HWkVB1AY`
- Correction Walrus blob: `mjxZQ1X2xn5Xlvd-gBsBAIrD5rkUDwFCAn1NEX0gbWY`
- Stored `supersedes` reference: claim `obs-sui-clock-341742424`, resolved to the predecessor blob
- First later recorded event: 1,381 ms after persistence, recalling proof-equivalent observation
  `zAji1w8p4REMzUF2o1V7IfgfQlpN7np7Qs8ehtNVXHg`

The public replay evaluates the actual correction blob. The historical later event recalled the
proof-equivalent observation, not that correction blob; the JSON contract discloses the distinction.

## 2. Run the MCP server end to end

```sh
npm run mcp:smoke
```

This spawns the stdio MCP server as a subprocess and exercises it with a real MCP client:
tool discovery (six tools), `recall_checked` on both recorded samples, revision-chain lineage, the
evidence overview, the invalid-argument path, and the `store_correction` write gate refusing by
default. All checks print `PASS`; no credentials or network are used.

To connect an agent, see [`mcp.md`](mcp.md) — Claude Code and Codex configurations, both verified.

## 3. Inspect the machine-readable proof

```sh
npm run --silent recall:checked -- --sample sui-clock-revision-lifecycle --json
```

The stable `recall_checked_lifecycle/v1` document reports:

- `read_only: true`
- `source.network_access: false`
- `behavior.sequence: ["STALE", "FRESH", "STALE"]`
- empty `writes` arrays at the top level and in both deterministic replays
- the two actual blob IDs, resolved lineage, recorded checkpoints, subject pins, and timing above

Missing, ambiguous, or inconsistent lifecycle evidence is rejected rather than converted into a
verdict. Those fail-closed cases are covered by `test/recorded-lifecycle.test.mjs`.

## 4. Open the site

```sh
npm run proof:offline
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8787>. The site is four static pages: the homepage (product story +
interactive demo), `/mcp.html` (tools + tested client configs), `/evidence.html` (every number
labelled), and `/docs.html` (quickstart → limitations). It makes no network requests and needs no
credentials.

If port 8787 is occupied:

```sh
node scripts/proof-page.mjs --offline --port=8801
```

For a serverless copy:

```sh
npm run export
```

This writes the four self-contained pages to `site/`. The export scans for `.env` values before
writing and fires no browser requests.

## 5. Run the tests and audits

```sh
npm test
npm run audit:secrets
node scripts/audit-history.mjs
```

Current suite: **149 tests, 149 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped** (MCP protocol tests included). Secrets
audit: **11 passes, 0 failures**; full-history audit: **0 findings**.

## 6. Verify the write boundary without writing

Recorded samples are always offline and read-only. This invalid opt-in fails before any network use:

```sh
npm run --silent recall:checked -- --allow-mainnet-writes
```

Expected: exit code 2 and
`--allow-mainnet-writes is valid only with --live. The recorded sample is always read-only.`
Live mode also defaults to read-only. Without credentials it exits before network access and names
all four required keys. `--allow-mainnet-writes` can incur Mainnet cost and must not be used without
the account owner's separate approval. The MCP `store_correction` tool is even stricter: it refuses
unless `RECALLGUARD_ENABLE_WRITES=true` **and** `confirm="STORE-CORRECTION"` **and** live mode.

## 7. Optional deeper offline demo

```sh
npm run demo:offline
```

This runs the longer cached-snapshot narrative over 22 memories and 306 recorded decisions. It ends
with zero stale answers from memory. The committed source is `docs/evidence/proof-snapshot.json`.

## 8. Optional container path

```sh
docker build -t recallguard .
docker run --rm recallguard
```

**Verification status: UNKNOWN.** The Docker path could not be executed in the build environment:
there was no Docker binary or socket. Its native command sequence was verified, but the image itself
must still be treated as unverified.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- `EADDRINUSE … 127.0.0.1:8787` — use `--port=8801` as shown above.
- `Cannot find module …/test` — use Node >=24; `nvm use` selects the pinned version.
- `no snapshot found` — restore the committed `docs/evidence/proof-snapshot.json`.
- MCP client shows the server as failed — check the absolute path and that `node` is on the
  client's PATH; run `node scripts/recallguard-mcp.mjs --help`.
- Live `429` responses — Tatum's shared limit may be exhausted; the 60-second path never calls it.
